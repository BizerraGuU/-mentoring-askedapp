## Why "askedapp"?

I have been mentoring with my cousin, and it was given to me by him so that I could create an algorithm with the following features, of a Restaurant algorithm:
|Features|What to Do|
|-|-|
|```1. Register Restaurants```|At this stage, the user is asked to enter the name of the restaurant they wish to register and what category the restaurant is. And, recently, it was requested to add the address, email and telephone number to be registered|
|```2. List Restaurants```|At this stage, the name of the restaurant is listed, along with its category, its status (activated or deactivated), its address, email and telephone number|
|```3. Change Restaurant Status```|At this stage, the user will change, in the application, the status of their restaurant: whether it is activated or deactivated. To do this, they will need to enter the name of the restaurant so that it only changes from the one entered.|
|```4. Exit```|Exit the application|

And, a few days ago, the:

|MASTER CHALLENGE|
|-|
|Create a search filter to find a restaurant based on the options: address, name, email, telephone number and category, and restaurant status.|

This application is based on [this algorithm](https://github.com/BizerraGuU/Python/blob/main/app.py), created by me a few months ago, with Python.
